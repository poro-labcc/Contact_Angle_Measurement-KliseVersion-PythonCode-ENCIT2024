Code used for measuring contact angle on x-ray microtomography images, based on the method proposed by Klise. et al (2016).

Klise, K.A., Moriarty, D., Yoon, H. and Karpyn, Z., 2016. “Automated contact angle estimation for three-dimensional x-ray microtomography data”. Advances in Water Resources, Vol. 95, pp. 152–160. ISSN 03091708. doi:10.1016/j.advwatres.2015.11.006.

This code can be used for measuring contact angle in segmented images of x-ray microtomography. It uses linear regression to calculate planes to fit the interfaces and uses the normal vectors of the interfaces to calculate the contact angle.

The acuracy is tested using a benchmark test as shown in the following article:
